abstract = {In the deep-sea, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is often marked by clay-rich condensed intervals caused by dissolution of carbonate sediments, capped by a carbonate-rich interval. Constraining the duration of both the dissolution and subsequent cap-carbonate intervals is essential to computing marine carbon fluxes and thus testing hypotheses for the origin of this event. To this end, we provide new high-resolution helium isotope records spanning the Paleocene–Eocene boundary at ODP Site 1266 in the South Atlantic. The extraterrestrial 3He, 3HeET, concentrations replicate trends observed at ODP Site 690 by Farley and Eltgroth (2003). By assuming a constant flux of 3HeET we constrain relative changes in accumulation rates of sediment across the PETM and construct a new age model for the event. In this new chronology the zero carbonate layer represents 35kyr, some of which reflects clay produced by dissolution of Paleocene (pre-PETM) sediments. Above this layer, carbonate concentrations increase for ∼165kyr and remain higher than in the latest Paleocene until 234 +48/−34kyr above the base of the clay. The new chronology indicates that minimum δ13C values persisted for a maximum of 134 +27/−19kyr and the inflection point previously chosen to designate the end of the CIE recovery occurs at 217 +44/−31kyr. This allocation of time differs from that of the cycle-based age model of Röhl et al. (2007) in that it assigns more time to the clay layer followed by a more gradual recovery of carbonate-rich sedimentation. The new model also suggests a longer sustained δ13C excursion followed by a more rapid recovery to pre-PETM δ13C values. These differences have important implications for constraining the source(s) of carbon and mechanisms for its subsequent sequestration, favoring models that include a sustained release of carbon after an initial pulse.}
